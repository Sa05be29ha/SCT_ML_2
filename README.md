Machine Learning Internship Tasks

This repository contains my internship tasks in the domain of Machine Learning.
Each task demonstrates the application of fundamental ML concepts using Python.
Task 02: Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

-> Problem Statement
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is the Mall Customer Dataset.
It contains information such as:
Customer ID
Gender
Age
Annual Income
Spending Score

-> Requirements
Install dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt should include:
numpy  
pandas  
matplotlib  
scikit-learn  
seaborn

How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SCT_ML_1.git
cd SCT_ML_1

2. Run the scripts:
For Task 02 (Customer Segmentation):

python task2_kmeans.py

Output:
Task 02:
Applies K-means clustering.
Groups customers into distinct segments based on purchase behavior.
Provides visualizations of clusters.
